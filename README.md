Predicting Bike Rentals
==============================

In numerous cities across the United States, communal bike sharing stations have become a popular means for individuals to rent bicycles, whether for a few hours or an entire day. Washington, D.C. is among the cities that have embraced this system, providing convenient access to bicycles for residents and visitors. As part of this initiative, the city maintains a comprehensive dataset that meticulously records the hourly and daily rental counts of bicycles. This dataset encompasses a substantial 17,380 rows, with each row representing the rental count for a specific hour on a particular day.

The following [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/nis-23/Predicting-Bike-Rentals/blob/main/notebooks/Main_Project_Walkthrough.ipynb) is a detailed walkthrough of the model development.
